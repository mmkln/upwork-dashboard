# Motion

This document maps Apple's current motion guidance to this product's web implementation. Use it before changing transitions, hover behavior, overlay presentation, collapsible navigation, loading feedback, or appearance changes.

## Principles

- Motion must explain state, continuity, or feedback. Do not add motion as decoration.
- Frequent interactions should use brief, precise feedback. Avoid making repeated navigation, filtering, and selection interactions wait for visible animation.
- Preserve spatial continuity. If an object remains the same object across states, keep its anchor stable.
- Avoid animating layout properties that cause text, icons, controls, or row contents to jump.
- Prefer opacity, color, and clipping reveals for appearance and disappearance.
- Use directional movement only when direction communicates where content came from or where it went.
- If a move does not communicate useful meaning, fade out, change layout, then fade in.
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`. Reduced motion should remove long movement, zooming, repeated animation, blur motion, and bounce.

## Tailwind Motion Tokens

The values below are web approximations that keep motion short and restrained.

| Token | Value | Use |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `duration-motion-instant` | `0ms` | State changes that must not animate. |
| `duration-motion-fast` | `120ms` | Hover, press, focus, color, opacity, and tooltip feedback. |
| `duration-motion` | `180ms` | Standard small state changes. |
| `duration-motion-medium` | `220ms` | Dialog and popover enter/exit when a little continuity helps. |
| `duration-motion-disclosure` | `240ms` | Sidebar width and other disclosure transitions. |
| `duration-motion-slow` | `300ms` | Loading/progress feedback where the user is already waiting. |
| `delay-motion-label` | `90ms` | Label reveal after a container has enough width. |
| `ease-motion-standard` | `cubic-bezier(0.2, 0, 0, 1)` | Default calm UI transitions. |
| `ease-motion-emphasized` | `cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1)` | Enter/disclosure transitions that need a softer finish. |
| `ease-motion-exit` | `cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 1, 1)` | Quick exits and disappearances. |

JS-driven animation can use `src/shared/theme/motion.ts`.

## Component Rules

### Controls

- Use `transition-colors duration-motion-fast ease-motion-standard` for buttons, inputs, toggles, menu rows, and hoverable list controls.
- Do not animate control size on hover.
- Do not use bounce or spring-like motion for routine hover/focus states.

### Collapsed Navigation

- Keep icon anchors stable across collapsed and expanded states.
- Reveal labels independently with `max-width` and `opacity`.
- On expand, let the container width open first, then reveal label with `delay-motion-label`.
- On collapse, hide the label immediately and keep the icon at the same anchor. Do not show a wide row with a centered icon.
- Do not animate `justify-content`, padding, or icon position between states.

### Overlays

- Dialogs, sheets, dropdowns, popovers, and tooltips can use short fade and small scale/slide transitions.
- Exits should be faster than enters.
- Avoid animating blur in and out locally; the global reduced-motion rule removes long transitions for users who request it.

### Disappearance

- If an element disappears from the same location, fade or clip it out.
- If the layout must change after disappearance, fade the element first, then let layout change.
- Do not leave invisible text in layout if it changes alignment. Use `max-w-0`, `hidden`, or an equivalent layout-neutral state.

## Reduced Motion

`src/index.css` includes a global `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` rule that shortens animations and transitions to `1ms`, removes transition delays, and disables smooth scrolling. Component code should still avoid excessive movement by default.
