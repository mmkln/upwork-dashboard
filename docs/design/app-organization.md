# App Organization And UX Structure

This document maps current Apple Human Interface Guidelines and WWDC25 design guidance to the product-level structure of this app: shell, navigation, pages, toolbars, content regions, detail panels, and temporary presentations.

## Product Structure

Use a stable app anatomy:

```text
AppShell
  Sidebar
  AppContent
    Header
    PageContainer
      PageShell
        PageHeader
        ContentToolbar
        ContentRegion
        DetailPanel | Inspector | Sheet | Dialog | Popover
```

- The sidebar and header are persistent app shell regions. Keep them anchored to the viewport/content edge by default; use material/island treatment only for temporary overlays, popovers, menus, and explicitly requested floating controls.
- Pages, tables, charts, forms, metrics, and cards are content. They should use block/surface/background tokens and stay visually calmer than navigation.
- Keep the same page anatomy across dashboard, lists, boards, and workflow screens so users do not have to relearn structure.
- Avoid page-specific shells when shared wrappers can express the same anatomy.

## Space And Layout

- Use a clear outer app gutter before adding extra panels.
- Keep the main content constrained with `max-w-content` on dense app pages.
- Use `max-w-readable` for page title actions, compact metadata, and long text outside the page header.
- Use `max-w-form` for single-purpose forms like login.
- Use `grid-cols-inspector` or `max-w-inspector` for list/detail and board/detail layouts.
- Prefer spacing, alignment, and typography over hard section borders.
- Do not make full pages look like a stack of bordered cards. Cards are for repeated content items, contained tools, and metrics.

## Navigation

- Sidebars expose stable top-level destinations and should remain shallow.
- Sidebar selection uses neutral rounded fills, stronger text/icon contrast, and focus state. Do not add active bars, rails, colored strips, dots, or decorative markers.
- If a content hierarchy becomes deeper than two levels, introduce a content list or detail panel instead of adding more sidebar depth.
- Keep account/workspace/settings actions visually separated from primary destinations.

## Toolbars And Search

- A toolbar acts on the content in the current view. It is not a general dumping ground for page actions.
- Group toolbar items by task: search, filters, view mode, pagination, export, and primary actions should be visually legible groups.
- Put search close to the collection it searches. For split/list views, search belongs in the toolbar for that list.
- Keep default toolbars short. If context, counters, filters, search, and settings all appear together, split them by priority and hide secondary information behind progressive disclosure.
- Do not put passive source summaries, explanatory copy, or setup status into the default toolbar just because they can fit there. Toolbars should expose controls that change or act on the visible content.
- Do not mix dense filters into a page title area. Page titles orient; toolbars manipulate content.
- Do not add descriptive subtitles under page titles. If explanatory copy is needed, place it inside the affected content region, empty state, onboarding state, or help surface.
- Use `ContentToolbar` for repeated page control rows instead of local bordered rows.

## Content, Lists, And Detail

- Use tables for comparison and scanning.
- Use lists or grids for selecting an item that opens detail.
- Use a detail panel or inspector when the user needs to inspect or edit an item without losing list context.
- Preserve selection while the user works in the detail panel.
- Avoid making detail panels look like nested pages. They should be lighter than the primary content region.
- Put passive source/filter/result counters near the content they explain, not as a large standalone dashboard section.
- Reserve large stat-card grids for overview pages where the metrics are the main content or directly drive a user decision.

## Presentations

- Use popovers for small contextual choices and previews.
- Use dialogs for short blocking decisions.
- Use sheets or drawers for focused temporary work.
- Move long, persistent, or reference-heavy workflows into a page or detail panel.
- Presentations should originate from a clear action and return the user to the same context.

## UX Rules

- Keep controls predictable: familiar placement is more important than novelty.
- Make the current location obvious with page titles, selected navigation, and consistent content anatomy.
- When the user is inside a saved board, project, collection, or research topic, use that object name as the page identity. Generic screen labels belong in navigation or eyebrow text.
- Use progressive disclosure for advanced filters and settings.
- Use short, specific labels. Remove redundant words that repeat the page title or app name.
- Preserve content visibility when controls appear; floating controls should not dominate the page.
- Default page chrome should reveal the primary content quickly. Avoid stacked setup cards, counter strips, and toolbar blocks before the table/list unless each visible block supports the immediate task.
- When improving a messy page, audit the sequence of neighboring regions, not only the requested component. Header, toolbar, filters, counters, alerts, and content must read as one workflow.
- Do not restyle clutter. First remove duplicated regions, demote passive context, and collapse secondary setup/details. Only then tune spacing, radius, color, or shadow.
- Keep navigation transitions stable. Users should not see intermediate states where a sidebar row is wide but only shows a centered icon, or where labels affect icon alignment.
- Empty, loading, and error states replace the content region they describe.

## Implementation Rules

- Use `PageShell`, `PageHeader`, and `ContentToolbar` from `src/shared/ui` for page-level structure.
- Use `PageContainer` only as the app-level page gutter, not as a feature-specific layout component.
- Use semantic layout tokens: `p-app-gutter`, `pt-content-gutter`, `ml-app-rail`, `max-w-content`, `max-w-readable`, `max-w-form`, `max-w-inspector`, `max-w-sheet-sm`, `max-w-sheet-md`, `max-w-modal-lg`, `max-w-modal-xl`, `max-w-viewport-safe`, `max-h-overlay`, `max-h-overlay-body`, `max-h-overlay-detail-body`, `max-w-detail-value`, `max-w-title`, `max-w-chip`, `min-w-table-sm`, `min-w-table-lg`, `min-w-status-trigger`, `min-w-status-menu`, `grid-cols-overview`, `grid-cols-inspector`, `grid-cols-job-detail`, `grid-cols-settings`, `grid-cols-signal-filters`, `w-sidebar-collapsed`, `hover:w-sidebar-expanded`, `min-w-search`, `max-w-search-compact`, `w-number-field`, and `w-popover`.
- Do not introduce hardcoded widths for repeated layout roles when a semantic token exists.
